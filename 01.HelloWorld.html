        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <h3>
                JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of 
                a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. 
                JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.

            You people may be aware of html structure. Right?
            JavaScript programming can be run in two different ways. One is writing the javascript code in the "script" tag in html file or we can create a file
            with ".js" as extention and write the code their and to run that code we still need to specify the file name containing javascript code in our html file.
            JavaScript file run only(as far of now) through the html files.

        <h4>Code for Printing Hello World in JavaScript:</h4>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">
            document.write("Hello World...!!!");
        </p>
        <p>The Above line prints the Hello World..!!! in the web page... Now the second method is that you can write the above line of code in 
            the other file with the extention as .js and include the file name in our html page point the scr: to the javascript filename...
        </p>
